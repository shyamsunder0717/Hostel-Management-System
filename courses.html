                <b> <h2 ><u>PHP</u></h2>
<p style="color: red;">PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.

    <P style="color: rgb(2, 2, 2);">(1) PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".
    
   <BR> <BR> (2) PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.
    
    <BR> <BR> (3) It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.
    
    <BR> <BR> (4) PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time. </p>

                <b><h2><u>PYTHON</u></h2></b>
<b><p style="color:red;">Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

 <P> <BR> <BR> (1) Python is Interpreted − <P style="color: rgb(253, 11, 11);">Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</P>
     (2)  Python is Interactive − 
     <P style="color: rgb(253, 11, 11);">You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</p>
         (3) Python is Object-Oriented − 
         <P style="color: rgb(253, 11, 11);">Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</P>
      (4) Python is a Beginner's Language − 
      <P style="color: rgb(253, 11, 11);">Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</p></b>                        <button type = "button" class = "btn">Know More</button>
